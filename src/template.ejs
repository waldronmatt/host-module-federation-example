      By default, you see we have two different jQuery versions running
      independently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The version above is what the host (this page) is using. The version
      inside the red border is the version the remote app is using.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open the console. The host has v.2 installed and throws a promise error in
      the console due to unspported features.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remote has v.3 installed and is successfully outputing to the console:
      (Failure 1, Success 2).
